# Purpose
Crimson Chronicles: The Age of Heroes (CC:TAoH for short) is a simple strategy game with randomly generated fights. It has been created as a project for Mgr. Duďo, who is our IT professor. 

# Usage
To use this app, download the application files and a Python Interpreter for Python3.12+. Then either create a virtual environment with packages listed in requirements.txt, or make sure you have all the packages installed. You can download all the packages using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt 
The game will start upon running:

    python starter.py

# Gameplay
Da-Gejm will play in two phases:
- Da-Shoping-Phazer in which you buy units for your army and equip them with possibly infinite number of weapons
- Da-Betl-Phazer, where your armada will fight the opposing team and *hopefully* wipe the floor with them.

## Da-Shoping-Phazer
During this phase of the game, you can buy units by clicking on their respective icons. They will then appear on the bottom of the screen. You can select units in your army by clicking on them and equip them with any number of weapons you like! (as long as you have enough money)

## Da-Betl-Phazer
During this phase, your army and the opponent's will take turns attacking each other. Since you are just a newbie, your opponent decided to let you play first. (ಠ◡ಠ)  
During your turn, you select your attacking unit and the enemy's defender by clicking on their images. Once you are happy with what units you have selected, you simply press 'Enter' and your brave warrior will initiate an attack!

# Contributing
If you are reading this and take this paragraph seriously, you should go visit a doctor. BUT, once we update and refactor the code to make it more expansion-friendly, you are welcome to fork this repository and create your own levels/units/weapons/mechanics and release them. It would be welcomed if you named your project Crimson Chronicles: <label>\<whatever the hell ya want\></label>
